Creating Tables and Indexes.

-- 1) Write a command that will enable a user to pull orders grouped by date out of the
-- Orders table quickly.

create index i_odate
on orders( odate);
=========================================================================================
-- 2) If the Orders table has already been created, how can you force the onum field to
-- be unique (assume all current values are unique)?

alter table orders add constraint unique_o_onum
unique (onum);
=========================================================================================
-- 3) Create an index that would permit each salesperson to retrieve his or her orders
-- grouped by date quickly.

create index i_sdate
on orders( odate);

=========================================================================================
-- 4) Let us assume that each salesperson is to have only one customer of a given
-- rating, and that this is currently the case. Enter a command that enforces it.

create index i_cnum_rating
on customers(cnum, rating);
