Maintaining the Integrity of your Data.

-- 1) Create a table called Cityorders. This will contain the same onum, amt and snum
-- fields as the Orders table, and the same cnum and city fields as the Customers
-- table, so that each customer’s order will be entered into this table along with his
-- or her city. Onum will be the primary key of Cityorders. All of the fields in
-- Cityorders will be constrained to match the Customers and Orders tables. Assume
-- the parent keys in these tables already have the proper constraints.


create table cityorders
(
	select onum,amt,snum,cnum,city
	from orders natural join customers
);
alter table cityorders 
add constraint pk_onum primary key(onum);

======================================
create table Cityorders 
(
onum int(4) primary key,
snum int(4) ,
amt float(7,2),
cnum int(4),
city varchar(10)

constraint fk_
); 

==========================================================================================
-- 2) Redefine the Orders table as follows:- add a new column called prev, which will
-- identify, for each order, the onum of the previous order for that current customer.
-- Implement this with a foreign key referring to the Orders table itself. The foreign
-- key should refer as well to the cnum of the customer, providing a definite
-- enforced link between the current order and the one referenced.



alter table orders
 add  column prev int(4);

alter table cityorders add
foreign key(cnum) refrences customers(cnum);

alter table orders1 add
foreign key(prev) refrences customers(onum);
